# Rock Paper Scissors with JavaScript

My first true program built with JavaScript. Currently runs off window.prompts to collect user inputs and if/else statements to verify legitimacy of user inputs. I'm planning to add on some additional features in the near future that utilize the DOM to display the win/loss/tie totals and buttons to allow the user to resume playing or start a new session with cleared totals.
